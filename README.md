# UILCompSciTeam-Challenges
This repository contains a series of problems that I solved in order to be selected for my school's UIL computer science team. These problems were custom-made by the 2023 Comp Sci Club president, and they presented a variety of different problems requiring numerous algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-first search, and more.
