# UILCompSciTeam-Challenges
This repository contains a series of problems that I solved in order to be selected for my school's UIL computer science team. These problems were custom-made by the 2023 Comp Sci Club president, and they presented a variety of different challenges requiring usage of numerous algorithms/searches, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-first search, etc.

Challenges:

1. Warm Up Basic Math (easy) - beginner challenge that tested foundations of coding, such as loops, simple algorithms, etc.
2. Fibonacci 48 (easy) - recursion/loop
3. Denis 1 (medium) - simplyifying fractions
4. Fourier TransformationTM (medium) - Base transformations
5. Ready SET Go (medium) - TreeSet manipulation
6. Counting Islands 1 (medium) - Depth first search
7. Trail of Primes (hard) - Breadth first search
8. Fastest Flight (hard) - Dijkstra's algorithm
