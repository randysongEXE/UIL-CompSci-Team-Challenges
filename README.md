# UILCompSciTeam-Challenges
This repository contains a series of problems that I solved in order to be selected for my school's UIL computer science team. These problems were custom-made by the 2023 Comp Sci Club president, and they presented a variety of different challenges requiring usage of numerous algorithms/searches, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-first search, etc. All problems were solved with Java.

Challenges:

1. Warm Up Basic Math (easy) - beginner challenge that tested foundations of coding, such as loops, simple algorithms, etc.
2. Fibonacci 48 (easy) - recursion/loop
3. Denis 1 (medium) - simplyifying fractions
4. Fourier TransformationTM (medium) - base transformations
5. Ready SET Go (medium) - treeSet manipulation
6. Counting Islands 1 (medium) - depth first search
7. Trail of Primes (hard) - breadth first search
8. Fastest Flight (hard) - dijkstra's algorithm

Special thanks to the Hebron Computer Science and UIL Competition Club president Ravi Shah for this opportunity.
